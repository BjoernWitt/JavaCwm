 * A structural feature refers to a static feature of a model element.

 * <p>
 * In the meta-model, a StructuralFeature declares a structural aspect of a Classifier that is typed, such as an attribute. For example, it specifies 
 * the multiplicity and changeability of the StructuralFeature. StructuralFeature is an abstract meta-class.
