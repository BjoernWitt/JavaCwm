/**
 * An object is an instance that originates from a class.
 * <p>
 * In the meta-model Object is a subclass of Instance originating from a Class. The Class may be modified dynamically, which means that the set of
 * features of the Object may change during its lifetime.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An object is an instance that originates from a class; it is structured and behaves according to its class. All objects originating from the same
 * class are structured in the same way, although each of them has its own set of attribute slots. Each attribute slot references an instance, usually
 * a data value or possibly another object. The number of attribute slots with the same name fulfills the multiplicity of the corresponding attribute
 * in the class. The set may be modified according to the specification in the corresponding attribute. For example, each referenced instance must
 * originate from (a specialization of) the type of the attribute, and attribute slots may be added or removed according to the changeable property of
 * the attribute.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An Object instance slots may contain either DataValue instances or other Object instances. Owned Object instances occur as side-effects of either
 * of two meta-model situations:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>First, the Classifier of the owning instance contains features (via the ClassifierFeature association) whose types are non-DataType
 * Classifiers.</li> 
 * <li>Second, the StructuralFeature describing the attribute slot is an AssociationEnd.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * An Object instance may own other Object instances. This occurs when the Classifier describing the owning Object contains the Classifier(s)
 * describing the owned object through namespace containment via the ElementOwnership association. Namespace rules imply that an Object instance
 * contained in another Object instance has access to all names that are accessible to its container instance.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Constraints:</b>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>[C-6-3]</b> - An CwmObject may only own CwmObjects and DataValues.</li>
 * <li><b>[C-6-4]</b> - If an CwmObject represents an association, at least two of its ends must not be empty.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This implementation was guided by the <a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/03-03-02">CWM Specification V1.1</a>
 * by <a href="http://www.omg.org">OMG</a>
