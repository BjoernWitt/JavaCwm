/**
 * UnionMembers are described as features of a Union and each represents one of the members of a Union. 
 * <p>
 * Note, however, that multiple case values can map to a single UnionMember. If isDefault is true, the union member is the default member. UnionMember 
 * instances are allowed to have a memberCase and be the default case. UnionMember instances often represent structured storage areas. A particular 
 * UnionMember may be associated with a Classifier that describes its internal structure via the StructuralFeatureType association (defined in the 
 * ObjectModel::Core package). 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, the Record::Group class, itself a Classifier, can be used as the type of a UnionMember in a manner completely analogous to how it is 
 * used to describe the type of a structured field (see the instance diagrams in the Record meta-model chapter for details). 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This implementation was guided by the  
 * <a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/03-03-02">CWM Specification V1.1</a> 
 * by <a href="http://www.omg.org">OMG</a>
