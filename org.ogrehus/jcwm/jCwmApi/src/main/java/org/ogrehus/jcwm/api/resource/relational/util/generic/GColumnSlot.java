/**
 * A slot is a named location in an Object instance that holds the current value of the StructuralFeature associated with the Slot instance.
 * <p>
 * Normally, the StructuralFeature associated with the slot will be either an Attribute instance or an AssociationEnd instance. Slots are owned by 
 * Objects; DataValues do not have slots.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Constraints:</b>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>[C-6-5]</b> - If the StructuralFeature describing a Slot is an AssociationEnd, the Classifier associated with the Object owning the Slot 
 * must be an Association.</li>
 * <li><b>[C-6-9]</b> - If the Slot instance is not also a DataSlot, the value reference must be present.</li>
 * </ul>
