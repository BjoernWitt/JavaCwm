/**
 * In the meta-model OrderingKind defines an enumeration that specifies how the elements of a set are arranged. 
 * <p>
 * Used in conjunction with elements that have a multiplicity in cases when the multiplicity value is greater than one. The ordering must be 
 * determined and maintained by operations that modify the set.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Values and meanings:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>ok_unordered</code> - The elements of the set have no inherent ordering.</li>
 * <li><code>ok_ordered</code> - The elements of the set have a sequential ordering.</li>
 * <li>The default value is <code>ok_unordered</code>.</li>
 * </ul>
