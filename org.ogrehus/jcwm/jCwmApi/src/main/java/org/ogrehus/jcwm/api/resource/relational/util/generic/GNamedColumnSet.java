 * A catalogued set of columns, which may be Table or View.

 * Note for typed tables: It is assumed that the typed table will own a set of columns conforming to the type they are OF. This set of columns allows 
 * the manipulation of the table by products that ignore this [SQL] extension. It also allows the columns of type REF, to be copied to a column with 
 * a SCOPE reference.
