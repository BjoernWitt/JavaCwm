/**
 * A AssociationSlot that is used to hold a data value where there is no need to manage the value as an element in its own right (in which case a 
 * DataValue would be used) - for example it is a one-off string value or a number.
 * <p>
 * The dataValue (and dataType where set) must be consistent with the type of the DataSlot feature (Attribute) and must obey any constraints on the 
 * full descriptor of the Attribute DataType (including both explicit constraints and built-in constraints such as multiplicity).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Constraints:</b>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>[C-6-6]</b> - A DataType instance associated with a DataSlot instance must be compatible with the type of the DataSlot indicated by the 
 * feature::type inherited from AssociationSlot.</li>
 * <li><b>[C-6-7]</b> - The StructuralFeature instance obtained via the feature reference inherited from AssociationSlot must be an Attribute.</li>
 * <li><b>[C-6-8]</b> - The value reference inherited from AssociationSlot must be empty.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The Constraint <b>[C-6-7]</b> will be achieved by narrowing the generic type of FEATURE to GAttribute
 * <p>
 * This implementation was guided by the <a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/03-03-02">CWM Specification V1.1</a>
