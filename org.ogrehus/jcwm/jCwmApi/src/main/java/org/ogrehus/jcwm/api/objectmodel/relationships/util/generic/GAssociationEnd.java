/**
 * An association end is an end-point of an association that connects the association to a classifier. 
 * <p>
 * Each association end is part of one association. The association ends of each association are ordered.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In the meta-model an AssociationEnd is part of an GAssociation and specifies the connection of an GAssociation to some other Classifier. Because 
 * AssociationEnds are a kind of StructuralFeature, they are owned and ordered by GAssociation instances via the ClassifierFeature association. The 
 * StructuralFeatureType association is used to identify the Classifier to which the AssociationEnd is attached. Each AssociationEnd has a name and 
 * defines a set of properties of the connection.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The multiplicity property of an association end specifies how many instances of the classifier at a given end (the one bearing the multiplicity 
 * value) may be associated with a single instance of the classifier at the other end. The association end also states whether or not the connection 
 * may be traversed towards the instance playing that role in the connection (the isNavigable attribute); that is, if the instance is directly 
 * reachable via the association.
 * </p> 
 * <p>
 * <b>Constraints:</b>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>[C-5-6]</b> - An AssociationEnd must have an owning GAssociation.</li>
 * <li><b>[C-5-7]</b> - The Classifier of an AssociationEnd cannot be an Interface or a DataType if the association is navigable away from that 
 * end.</li>
 * <li><b>[C-5-8]</b> - An Instance may not belong by composition to more than one composite Instance.</li>
 * <li><b>[C-5-9]</b> - An AssociationEnd with composite or shared aggregation semantics must be owned by an GAssociation.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This implementation was guided by the <a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/03-03-02">CWM Specification V1.1</a> 
 * by <a href="http://www.omg.org">OMG</a>
