/**
 * A dependency states that the implementation or functioning of one or more elements requires the presence of one or more other elements.
 * <p>
 * In the meta-model a Dependency is a directed relationship from a client (or clients) to a supplier (or suppliers) stating that the client is
 * dependent on the supplier; that is, the client element requires the presence and knowledge of the supplier element.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A dependency specifies that the semantics of a set of model elements requires the presence of another set of model elements. This implies that if
 * the source is somehow modified, the dependents probably must be modified. The reason for the dependency can be specified in several different ways
 * (for example, using natural language or an algorithm) but is often implicit.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Whenever the supplier element of a dependency changes, the client element is potentially invalidated. After such invalidation, a check should be
 * performed followed by possible changes to the derived client element. Such a check should be performed after which action can be taken to change
 * the derived element to validate it again.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This implementation was guided by the <a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/03-03-02">CWM Specification V1.1</a> by
 * <a href="http://www.omg.org">OMG</a>
