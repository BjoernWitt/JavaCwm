/**
 * A PackageUsage represents a usage of a Package. It is particularly relevant in situations where a specific usage uses an alternative name for the 
 * Package, as this alternative name can be recorded using the packageAlias attribute.
 * <p>
 * For example, if a DataProvider representing an ODBC or JDBC client uses a name for a relational database that is different from the dataPackage 
 * name used by the RDBMS server, a PackageUsage that has the relevant ProviderConnection as client and the server data Package as supplier can be 
 * added. Its packageAlias attribute can be used to record the name by which the data Package is known to the DataProvider.
 * </p>
 *  
 * <p>
 * <b>Constraints</b>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>[C-8-1]</b> A PackageUsage must have a single Package (or subtype of Package) as its supplier.</li>
 * </ul>
