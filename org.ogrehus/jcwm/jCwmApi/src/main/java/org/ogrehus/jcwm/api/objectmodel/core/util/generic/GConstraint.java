/**
 * A constraint is a semantic condition or restriction expressed in text.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In the meta-model a Constraint is a BooleanExpression on an associated ModelElement(s) that must be true for the model to be well formed. This 
 * restriction can be stated in natural language, or in different kinds of languages with well defined semantics. Certain Constraints are predefined, 
 * others may be user defined. Note that a Constraint is an assertion, not an executable mechanism.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The specification is written as an expression in a designated constraint language. The language can be specially designed for writing constraints 
 * (such as OCL), a programming language, mathematical notation, or natural language. If constraints are to be enforced by a model editor tool, then 
 * the tool must understand the syntax and semantics of the constraint language. Because the choice of language is arbitrary, constraints can be used 
 * as an extension mechanism.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The constraint concept allows new semantics to be specified linguistically for a model element. In the meta-model a Constraint directly attached 
 * to a ModelElement describes semantic restrictions that this ModelElement must obey.
