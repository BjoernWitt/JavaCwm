/**
 * A namespace is a part of a model that contains a set of ModelElements each of whose names designates a unique element within the namespace. 
 * <p>
 * In the meta-model, a Namespace is a ModelElement that can own other ModelElements, such as Classifiers. The name of each owned ModelElement must 
 * be unique within the Namespace. Moreover, each contained ModelElement is owned by at most one Namespace. The concrete subclasses of Namespace may 
 * have additional constraints on which kind of elements may be contained.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Namespace is an abstract metaclass.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that explicit parts of a model element, such as the features of a GClassifier, are not modeled as owned elements in a namespace. A namespace 
 * is used for unstructured contents such as the contents of a package, or a class declared inside the scope of another class. 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This implementation was guided by the  
 * <a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/03-03-02">CWM Specification V1.1</a> by
