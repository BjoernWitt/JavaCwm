/**
 * The Union class represents programming language unions and similarly structured data types. 
 * 
 * <p>
 * Because of the diversity of union semantics found across software systems, the Union and UnionMember classes are likely candidates for 
 * specialization to better capture union semantics in specific language extension packages.
 * <p>
 * A discriminated Union has a collection of UnionMembers that determine the sets of contents that the Union may contain. Such Unions have an 
 * attribute called the discriminator that identifies the memberCase value of the UnionMember that the Union currently contains. The discriminator is 
 * found via the UnionDiscriminator association to StructuralFeature. The discriminator may be embedded within UnionMembers or may be located outside 
 * the discriminator. If it is located within UnionMembers, the discriminator should occur in every UnionMember at the same location (often, the 
 * first).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Undiscriminated unions (for example, a C language union) are also supported, but have an empty discriminator reference, and the memberCase 
 * attribute of the UnionMembers it contains is ignored.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Undiscriminated Unions are often used to represent alternate views of a single physical storage area. A fine degree of control over this aspect of 
 * Unions may be obtained by creating a class that derives from both UnionMember and FixedOffsetField (in the CWM Record package) and setting the 
 * offset attribute instances of that class accordingly.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Constraints</b>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>[Foundation_C-4-2]</b> A Union can have at most one default UnionMember instance.</li>
 * </ul>
 *  
 * <p>
 * This implementation was guided by the  
 * <a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/03-03-02">CWM Specification V1.1</a> 
 * by <a href="http://www.omg.org">OMG</a>
