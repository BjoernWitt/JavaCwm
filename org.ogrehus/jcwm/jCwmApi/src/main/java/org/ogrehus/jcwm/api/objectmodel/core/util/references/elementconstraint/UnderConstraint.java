	 * the system is stable; that is, not in the middle of an atomic operation.

	 * The ElementConstraint association provides linkages between  ModelElements and the Constraint instances that constrain their state. Note that a
	 * Constraint instance may not simultaneously participate in both the ElementConstraint and the StereotypeConstraint associations.

	 * The StereotypeConstraints association links Stereotypes with Constraints that further restrict the states that a stereotyped ModelElement may 
	 * assume. A Constraint instance may not simultaneously participate in both the StereotypeContraints association and the ElementConstraint 
	 * association.
