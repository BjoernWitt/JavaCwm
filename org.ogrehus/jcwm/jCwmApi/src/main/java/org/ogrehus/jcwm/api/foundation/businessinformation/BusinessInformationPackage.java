/**
 * BusinessInformationPackage provides hierarchical access to any factory method in this jCwmAPI in scope of the package 
 * <code>businessinformation</code>.
 * <p>
 * To work with the jCwm you need to choose an implementation of the API. For example its recommends to use the reference implementation provided by 
 * <a href="http://www.ogrehus.org">www.ogrehus.org</a> too. Otherwise you can implement your own if you need specific functionality like more 
 * immutable objects for more thread safety or final classes that can't be extended for security reasons.
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage of FoundationPackage:</b>
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * ...
 * BusinessInformationPackage factory = BusinessInformationPackage.create( "org.ogrehus.jcwm.impl.foundation.businessinformation.FunBusinessInformationPackage" );
 * Contact                    contact  = factory.createContact(...);
 * Document                   document = factory.createDocument(...);
 * ... 
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This implementation was guided by the <a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/03-03-02">CWM Specification V1.1</a>
