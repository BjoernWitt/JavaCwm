/**
 * A generalization is a taxonomic relationship between a more general element and a more specific element.
 * <p>
 * The more specific element is fully consistent with the more general element (it has all of its properties, members, and relationships) and may 
 * contain additional information.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In the meta-model a Generalization is a directed inheritance relationship, uniting a Classifier with a more general Classifier in a hierarchy. 
 * Generalization is a subtyping relationship; that is, an instance of the more general (parent) Classifier may be substituted by an instance of the 
 * more specific (child) Classifier.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To understand inheritance fully, it is necessary to understand the concept of a full descriptor and a segment descriptor. A full descriptor is the 
 * full description needed to describe an instance of a meta-model object. It contains a description of all of the attributes, associations, and 
 * operations that the object contains.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In a pre-object-oriented language, the full descriptor of a data structure was declared directly in its entirety. In an object-oriented language, 
 * the description of an object is built out of incremental segments that are combined using inheritance to produce a full descriptor for an object. 
 * The segments are the modeling elements that are actually declared in a model. Each classifier contains a list of features and other relationships 
 * that it adds to what it inherits from its ancestors. The mechanism of inheritance defines how full descriptors are produced from a set of segments 
 * connected by generalization. The full descriptors are implicit, but they define the structure of actual instances. Features of a classifier that 
 * have private visibility are not visible to descendants of the classifier.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If a classifier has no parent, then its full descriptor is the same as its segment descriptor. If a classifier has one or more parents, then its 
 * full descriptor contains the union of the features from its own segment descriptor and the segment descriptors of all of its ancestors. No 
 * attribute, operation, or association end with the same signature may be declared in more than one of the segments (in other words, they may not be 
 * redefined). A method may be declared in more than one segment. A method declared in any segment supersedes and replaces a method with the same 
 * signature declared in any ancestor. If two or more methods nevertheless remain, then they conflict and the model is ill formed.The constraints on 
 * the full descriptor are the union of the constraints on the segment itself and all of its ancestors. If any of them are inconsistent, then the 
 * model is ill formed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In any full descriptor for a classifier, each method must have a corresponding operation. In a concrete classifier, each operation in its full 
 * descriptor must have a corresponding method in the full descriptor.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This implementation was guided by the <a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/03-03-02">CWM Specification V1.1</a> 
 * by <a href="http://www.omg.org">OMG</a>
