 * In the meta-model Changeable defines an enumeration that denotes how an attribute link may be modified.

 * Values and meanings:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>changeable</code> - No restrictions on modification.</li>
 * <li><code>frozen</code> - The value may not be changed from the source end after the creation and initialization of the source object. Operations 
 * on the other end may change a value.</li>
 * <li><code>addOnly</code> - If the multiplicity is not fixed, values may be added at any time from the source object, but once created a value may 
 * not be removed from the source end. Operations on the other end may change a value.</li>
 * <li>The default value is <code>changeable</code>.</li>
