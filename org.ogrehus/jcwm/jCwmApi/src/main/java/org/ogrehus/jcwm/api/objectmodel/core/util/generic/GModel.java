/**
 * A model captures a view of a physical system. 
 * 
 * <p>
 * It is an abstraction of the physical system, with a certain purpose. The model completely describes those aspects of the physical system that are 
 * relevant to the purpose of the model, at the appropriate level of detail.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In the meta-model Model is a subclass of Package. It contains a containment hierarchy of ModelElements that together describe the physical system. 
 * A Model also contains a set of ModelElements that represents the environment of the system.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Different Models can be defined for the same physical system, where each model represents a view of the physical system defined by its purpose 
 * and abstraction level; for example, an analysis model, a design model, an implementation model. Typically different models are complementary and 
 * defined from the perspectives (viewpoints) of different system stakeholders.
 * </p>
