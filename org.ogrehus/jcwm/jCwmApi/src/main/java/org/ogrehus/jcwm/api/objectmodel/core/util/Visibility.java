 * In the meta-model Visibility defines an enumeration that denotes how the element to which it refers is seen outside the enclosing name space.

 * Values and meanings:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>vk_public</code> - Other elements may see and use the target element.</li>
 * <li><code>vk_protected</code> - Descendants of the source element may see and use the target element.</li>
 * <li><code>vk_private</code> - Only the source element may see and use the target element.</li>
 * <li><code>vk_package</code> - Elements declared in the same package as the target element may see and use the target element.</li>
 * <li><code>vk_notapplicable</code> - May be used where namespaces do not support the concept of visibility.</li>
 * <li>The default value is <code>vk_public</code>.</li>
