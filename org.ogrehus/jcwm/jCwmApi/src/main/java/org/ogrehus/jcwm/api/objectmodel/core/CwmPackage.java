/**
 * A package is a grouping of model elements.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In the meta-model Package is a subclass of Namespace. A Package contains ModelElements such as Packages and Classifiers. A Package may also contain
 * Constraints and Dependencies between ModelElements of the Package.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The purpose of the package construct is to provide a general grouping mechanism. In fact, its only semantics is to define a namespace for its 
 * contents. The package construct can be used for organizing elements for any purpose; the criteria to use for grouping elements together into one
 * package are not defined.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A package owns a set of model elements, with the implication that if the package is removed from the model, so are the elements owned by the
 * package. Elements with names, such as classifiers, that are owned by the same package must have unique names within the package, although elements
 * in different packages may have the same name.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There may be relationships between elements contained in the same package, and between an element in one package and an element in a surrounding
 * package at any level. In other words, elements see all the way out through nested levels of packages. Elements in peer packages, however, are
 * encapsulated and are not a priori visible to each other. The same goes for elements in contained packages; that is, packages do not see inwards.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Elements owned by a Package can be made available to other Packages by importing them. Although any ModelElement may be imported by a Package,
 * imported ModelElements are typically other Packages. When an element is imported by a package it extends the namespace of that package. Thus the
 * elements available in a Package consists of its owned and imported ModelElements.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This implementation was guided by the <a href="http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/03-03-02">CWM Specification V1.1</a> 
 * by <a href="http://www.omg.org">OMG</a>
