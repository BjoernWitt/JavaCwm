/**
 * An association defines a semantic relationship between classifiers. 
 * <p>
 * Associations have two or more named ends. Associations with two or more ends are called n-ary whereas associations with exactly two ends are 
 * called binary. Each end, depending upon its multiplicity, connects to zero or more instances of some classifier.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In the meta-model, an GAssociation is a declaration of a semantic relationship between Classifiers, such as Classes. Associations must have two, 
 * and may have more, association ends. Each end is connected to a Classifier; the same Classifier may be connected to more than one association end 
 * in the same association. (Refer to the ObjectModel's Instance package, below, for a description of how Associations are instantiated.)
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Because Associations are classifiers, they own and order their association ends (which are Attributes) via the ClassifierFeature association. In 
 * addition, because Associations are Classes, they can also own more traditional StructuralFeatures such as Attributes. Consequently, they may act in
 * a manner similar to association classes described by some other object models.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An association may represent an aggregation; that is, a whole/part relationship. In this case, the association end attached to the whole element is
 * designated, and the other association end represents the parts of the aggregation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Associations can be of three different kinds:
 * </p> 
 * <ol>
 * <li>ordinary association</li>
 * <li>composite aggregate</li>
 * <li>and shareable aggregate</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Since the aggregate construct can have several different meanings depending on the application area, CWM gives a more precise meaning to two of 
 * these constructs; that is, association and composite aggregate and leaves the shareable aggregate more loosely defined in between. Only binary 
 * Associations can have composite or sharable aggregation semantics.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Composite aggregation is a strong form of aggregation, which requires that a part instance be included in at most one composite at a time and that 
 * the composite object has sole responsibility for the disposition of its parts. This means that the composite object is responsible for the creation
 * and destruction of the parts. In implementation terms, it is responsible for their memory allocation. If a composite object is destroyed, it must 
 * destroy all of its parts. It may remove a part and give it to another composite object, which then assumes responsibility for it. If the 
 * multiplicity from a part to composite is zero-to-one, the composite may remove the part and the part may assume responsibility for itself, 
 * otherwise it may not live apart from a composite.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A consequence of these rules is that a composite aggregation implies propagation semantics; that is, some of the dynamic semantics of the whole is 
 * propagated to its parts. For example, if the whole is copied or destroyed, then so are the parts as well (because a part may belong to at most one 
 * composite). 
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A classifier on the composite end of an association may have parts that are classifiers and associations. At the instance level, an instance of a 
 * part element is considered part of the instance of a composite element. If an association is part of a composite and it connects two classes that
 * are also part of the same composite, then an instance of the association will connect objects that are part of the same composite object of which 
 * the instance is 
 * part.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A shareable aggregation denotes weak ownership; that is, the part may be included in several aggregates and its owner may also change over time. 
 * However, the semantics of a shareable aggregation does not imply deletion of the parts when an aggregate referencing it is deleted. Both kinds of 
 * aggregations define a transitive, antisymmetric relationship; that is, the instances form a directed, non-cyclic graph. Composition instances form 
 * a strict tree (or rather a forest).
 * </p>

 * <b>Constraints:</b>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>[C-5-1]</b> - An GAssociation must have at least two AssociationEnds.</li>
 * <li><b>[C-5-2]</b> - The AssociationEnds must have a unique name within the association.</li>
 * <li><b>[C-5-3]</b> - At most one AssociationEnd may be an aggregation or composition.</li>
 * <li><b>[C-5-4]</b> - If an GAssociation has three or more AssociationEnds, then no AssociationEnd may be an aggregation or composition.
 * <li><b>[C-5-5]</b> - The connected Classifiers of the AssociationEnds should be included in the Namespace of the GAssociation, or be Classifiers 
 * with public visibility in other Namespaces to which the GAssociation has access.</li>
