/**
 * An enumeration that denotes what kind of aggregation an Association defines.
 * <p>
 * When placed on a target end, specifies the relationship of the target end to the source end.
 * <p>
 * Values and meanings:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>none</code> - The end is not an aggregate.</li>
 * <li><code>aggregate</code> - The end is an aggregate; therefore, the other end is a part and must have the aggregation value of none. The part may 
 * be contained in other aggregates.</li>
 * <li><code>composite</code> - The end is a composite; therefore, the other end is a part and must have the aggregation value of none. The part is 
 * strongly owned by the composite and may not be part of any other composite.</li>
 * <li>The default value is <code>none</code>.</li>
